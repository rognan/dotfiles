# My dots

I guess it comes as no surprise that I've been gathering dots here and there, so here's a list of some of my victims:

* [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
* [Mir Nazim](http://mirnazim.org/writings/vim-plugins-i-use/)
* [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)
* [Yan Pritzker](https://github.com/skwp)
* [GitHub ignores](https://github.com/github/gitignore), and of course [GitHub dots](http://dotfiles.github.com/)

**Thank you!**
